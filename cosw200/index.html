    <h3>Homework 1</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/hbalajadia/full/rNwwWQg" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 1.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>The simple quiz was a good introduction to how JavaScript works. I hope everyone is able to answer the questions correctly!</p>

    <h3>Homework 2</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/hbalajadia/full/wvemQML" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 2.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>When it came to this assignment, I remembered there was an adventure builder on Neopets I really liked. You would just write out the scenarios and then connect each message to the one before it. This has given me greater appreciation since I had to go in and create the conditions myself!</p>

    <h3>Homework 3</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/hbalajadia/full/abwQLPa" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 3.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>Working with this assignment was cool since it actively manipulated data that I put in, and even added people to the data (like Tony Stark and Tom Holland).</p>

    <h3>Homework 4</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/hbalajadia/full/ZEyNzVz" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 4.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>If you ever got stuck when creating a fantasy character or an OC because you liked all of the customization options, this is for you! Take some time to re-roll it if you don't get the stats you like... I personally go for higher charisma.</p>

    <h3>Homework 5</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/hbalajadia/full/MWvpWOB" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 5.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>Actively coding JavaScript to be able to add to this list was a challenge for me, but once I got it right, I saw just how those applications would be amazing in other websites.</p>

    <h3>Homework 6</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://cosw300json.hbalajadia1.repl.co/" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 6.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>Being able to have data stored on a separate file and then be used in a website that can actively updated is amazing and really useful. So when creating this list, and more importantly, seeing it populate the info was great.</p>
  </div>

    <h3>Homework 7</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://jsvalidate--hbalajadia1.repl.co/" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Homework 7.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>Form validation, enough said. Where I work I do a lot of form validation and taking in information so this is great.</p>

    <h3>Research Project</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://researchproject--hbalajadia1.repl.co/" target="_blank"> <img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" src="images/Research Project.png" width="3360" height="2100" alt=""/> </a>
    <p>For a project on a JavaScript library, I did it on React. I want to be able to learn it because there's so much I can see myself using it with/for. Plus, Facebook and Instagram use it!</p>
