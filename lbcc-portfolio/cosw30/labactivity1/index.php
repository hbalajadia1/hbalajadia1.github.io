    <h1>Hello, it's Hilario!</h1>
    <img src="icon.png" alt="Animal Crossing-style icon"></img><h2>I’m Hilario Balajadia, Jr. !</h2>
    <p>I’m currently a technical trainer for an engineering company here in Long Beach, CA. I like long walks on short beaches and short walks to the fridge. I also like playing and collecting video games, particularly for the Nintendo Switch console. I own approximately 80+ games, with some exclusives being imported from Japan.</p>
    <?php
      echo '<p>Currently I\'m obsessed with a game called Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia. It\'s where I get to complete quests with a party made up characters mixed from all of the different Final Fantasy games I love! I\'m using this website <a href="https://ootracker.com/directory/gl/366000539">here</a> as a tracker of my progress and making sure I can make sure my favorites have all the right gear. It helps a lot with asking people on Discord for help! I also use <a href="https://www.tonberrytroupe.com">Tonberry Troupe</a> to be able to keep up with all of the events because there are a lot! And then... there\'s always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> to be able to learn as much as I can about games!</p>';
