                            <p class="card-text scrollbox"><i>This week was mostly a refresher on what PHP is and how I can use it
                                within HTML.</i><br> PHP is definitely more useful because it can be used for forms among other things.<br> I think what was the easiest (and my favorite part) was writing my bio!<br> I like being able to write content
                            on stuff that interests me.<br> The most challenging part was formatting the hyperlinks within the PHP since there needs to be the use of slashes and such.<br> Once I remembered the parts for the slashes, it was pretty easy!<br>                            This class is the last class I’m taking for the AS Web Development program so it’s exciting to see everything come to a head here!<br> It’s simple and I feel like it’s a quick representation of who I am as a person.<br> Plus,
                            anytime I can use aliceblue makes me happy.<br> I think generally being confident in my work is something I can improve on, and that comes with practice and getting more familiar with the material.

                                <i>This week was still a little bit of a refresher, but we focused on form
                                submission and validation and using the submit action across different pages to check if
                                the information was correct (this was at a macro level and was very simple while in the
                                future we’d be using a SQL table).</i><br> The easiest thing was writing the boolean statements to make sure that things were correct.
                                <br> I want to try maybe doing something in the future with a lot of nested statements for checking each individual field, but at the time of submission, I just have separate validation for password and confirm password.<br>                                The most challenging thing was making sure that everything was linked correctly.<br> So, when I declared the variable as $confirmedpassword in one place and as $confirmpassword in another and was getting an error because
                                the password information wasn’t matching, but, after I got it… it worked perfectly!<br> At undergrad at CSULB, I did a little bit of PHP and this is giving me a lot more practice and I am way more confident in my ability.<br>                                I think that in the past I would’ve taken much longer to finish everything, but now, after many years of experience, I feel like I can keep up with the work and really absorb the information.
                                <br> I think generally being confident in my work is something I can improve on, and that comes with practice and getting more familiar with the material.<br> It’s a generic comment from last week, but, after hearing/watching
                                about the types of programmers, definitely working harder at my own personal work ethic and how I look at everything is important to me.

It helps make pages more dynamic and now we can get useful information and apply things like a tax to a sales page.</i><br>I
                            didn’t realize that getting information from a form from one page to another was super straightforward; also PHP has similar coding conventions to other languages.<br>Formatting the receipt on a table was probably the toughest
                            part, but, it makes it look so nice!<br>I think following along with the class example showed me it’s as easy as declaring it in two places and using proper tags.<br>I think the nice part is that everything (I've learned) is
                            useful; it’s all coming back to me. It’s really nice!<br>I like that I was able to use my CSS knowledge to make it feel a bit more professional/cohesive with the section I added.<br>I think I can improve on just getting more
                            comfortable with everything! And feeling confident that my work is good! :) </p>

                        <p class="card-text scrollbox"><i>This was creating a random sentence/paragraph generator! This was something that was pretty interesting. Using functions to create a paragraph of a random number of sentences, sentences that were a random length of words, and then random words from a word bank.</i><br>                            I think when it came to it, the pseudocode exercises were easy, so I assumed the actual lab would be easy, but that was not the case…<br> The challenge was when I had really short sentences! I’d have missing periods or double
                            capitals which isn’t correct for this lab.<br> Checking on the semantics of a sentence (if it had to be grammatically correct) as well as the minimum words for a sentence (technically, 2) made it so I could use those parameters
                            in order to make sure the sentences semantically followed the rules of the lab.<br> Practicing more CSS and I even threw in a button to refresh the page and generate new paragraphs!<br> I think I liked that this was simple,
                            and that’s what I like! Addding in those CSS hover elements. too.<br> The speed at which I finished this assignment… I think I took longer than the suggested time but that’s okay because I’m still learning!<br>

                            <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br> Using a table for all of these outputs, as per usual from my other experiences, makes everything look really nice!<br>

                            <b>What was easy?</b><br> I think what made this lab “easy” was being able to follow along with the tutorial provided with the video lecture.<br>
                            <b>What was challenging?</b><br> I think the hardest part for me was finding a cheap/free way to host a website AND also host a database. I’ll be linking those resources below!<br>
                            <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br> Once I had everything set up, the AHA was just connecting it all together. I originally used repl.it to test my code, but I realized that all of the repls are public and thus are not secure… so
                            hosting a free website with private file storing was a good idea to have more security.<br>
                            <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br> I think what’s more coming together is the information I learned in undergrad where we learned about the structure of websites and web applications
                            and where certain pieces of code/files should be (absolute paths and including files within other files.<br>
                            <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br> I learned a lot of this during undergrad but I kind of did assignments just to pass the class (since the class was more focused on many subjects that encompassed web design).
                            I mentioned that I figured out styles I like and I’m carrying throughout assignments, but, with this class having a focus on PHP and MySQL, I can definitely showcase my proficiency with those languages.<br>
                            <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br> I definitely should be getting my own website for the future so I can store my own data and files and have a professional portfolio.<br>

                            <b>What was challenging?</b><br>Getting the redirect to work! I used JavaScript to accomplish it, which is out of scope for this class…<br>
                            <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>I wasn’t passing the ID because of how I titled it in the list_departments.php file, but once I changed it, it made sense.<br> I also needed to make sure I got compound words! That was a challenge.<br>
                            <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>More and more information from this class, actually. Seeing how everything connects together to be able to build out more robust and functional websites
                            is very nice.

                            <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br> I should start looking at resources that aren’t free because this is all building up my portfolio.

                            Using the previous form as a base made this a lot easier. Plus, I remember a lot of the simple validation stuff.<br>
                            <b>What was challenging?</b><br>
                            The most challenging was the CSS and making sure it worked for both pages with one style sheet.<br>
                            <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
                            Once I realized how information is passed for stuff like the age range and the family status, it made a lot of sense and helped me do some really cool messages based on that information.<br>
                            <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
                            It’s cool to see this as an end product for the week, and also how this is going to be a great jumping-off point for when we use SQL.<br>
                            <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
                            It’s still very simple but it gets all of the stuff it needs.<br>
                            <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
                            I think just getting more creative/experimental with some of the CSS stuff is going to be good. I’ve taken classes where we use frameworks/etc, so I have some experience there. Seeing how I can tie that here would be really cool.<br>

Since this came after Lab 3, following the pattern of getting user input and then using it came easy.<br>
<b>What was challenging?</b><br>
I’d still have to say formatting the receipt in a table format was the most difficult part… it’s not necessary for it to work but it definitely looks fancy.<br>
<b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
Now, when I said declaring it for Lab 3, the AHA for the project was that if the name of a variable was slightly off (an underscore, an extra letter, etc.) it would totally throw everything off!<br>

                            After doing Lab 4, this project was a bit easy since I did break things up into different methods.<br>
                            <b>What was challenging?</b><br>
                            I didn’t know where to put all of the different pieces! Where was I going to randomize the number of sentences in each paragraph as well as the words in each paragraph… It was elusive to me!<br>
                            <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
                            The ‘A-HA’ moment was realizing that the sentences in the paragraph should be decided in the beginning while the number of sentences can be decided at the end of the previous sentence; that way it does not leave all of the sentences being the exact same length (unless done randomly, of course).<br>
                            <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
                            The structure of how to put in different loops inside of loops.<br>
                            <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
                            I like how sometimes it can make real paragraphs and sentences!<br>
                            <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
                            Maybe I can work on this more to get some more robust sentences; I worked on something like this for my masters and now I have more insight!<br>

Having the last assignment definitely made this one a lot easier! And using previous form information/formatting.<b<br>
<b>What was challenging?</b><br>
Having to remember to renew my free resources every week I was working on it!<br>
Making sure I understood the difference between running the query and storing the query to a variable.<br>
I didn’t set up my ID in my user table to auto-increment, so I had to fiddle with the data to get it to work correctly.<br>
<b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
Once that was squared away, the testing made it really easy! Seeing information from the form populate on my SQL table was really interesting.<br>

I mentioned this last time, but, in undergrad, since this was an elective course, I only glossed over it briefly (PHP and MySQL). Now I’m getting a ton of practice.<br>
<b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
I think I’m getting faster at doing the work, I think.<br>
<b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
I definitely should be getting my own website for the future so I can store my own data and files and have a professional portfolio (which I mentioned last week).<br>
As much as I like the simple aesthetic (simple and be quite appealing to look at), I feel like before the end of the class I should come up with a particular look of how I want everything to be coherent as a website/portfolio.<br>

Using the older files as a base for this! I definitely like the scaffolding of this class.<br>

Personally, I’ve had a family tragedy come up so doing the work this week was very difficult.<br>
But on the content matter itself, making sure to update links as necessary and trying to get the sorting and pagination for the responses to work as well. :( [I still need to work on that].<br>
<b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
The biggest AHA was that I wasn’t getting the tables updated, but it came down to a difference between ` and ‘ and “. Once that was figured out, it was golden!<br>
<b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
I’m noticing a lot of patterns to be able to complete SQL a lot easier which is nice.<br>

Finishing up the requirements for this Web Project! I’ll get you, pagination.<br>

                                      This assignment is easy but is time-consuming (and at this point of writing this on May 8th, it’s incomplete.)<br>
                                      <b>What was challenging?</b><br>
                                      I think the challenging thing is my full-time job at the moment. I work as a technical trainer for a company and with some personal work constraints dealing with a coworker leaving and the absolvement of their projects and redistributing work, I am finding it a little bit harder to finish this course.<br>
                                      <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
                                      The biggest AHA moment for me will be to work during the downtime from my other duties to finish this project along with the other work so I can make sure I don’t experience burnout especially this late in the semester.<br>
                                      <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
                                      Being able to connect pieces of checking proper email addresses, and passwords, and uploading the files will be nice (especially once I get it to work).<br>
                                      <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
                                      I think, even at this moment, the thing I like the most about my work is I am being very honest with myself and making sure I am turning in my own work. Not very commendable at this point since I didn’t finish this project yet, but, I would rather turn in my own work late than try to cut corners.<br>
                                      <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
                                      My time management for the last part of the semester; I really want to finish everything strong and even if I am turning in this project late, the rest of the work for the semester will really build on this so I am taking this mistake on my part with stride in the hopes of doing better.<br>

                                      When writing this, the only piece I am still working on is the file upload part of the form (and making the img show up in the list_users.php page). I’m also testing having the URL of the image in the SQL table to see if it’ll connect properly.<br>
                                      Also at the time of writing this, I’m having internet issues! So I cannot test it to the full ability I should be. 000webhost’s FTP service has been down.<br>
                                      What was challenging?<br>
                                      The most challenging thing is making sure things work from place to place, making sure that a particular field is being carried over/referenced the same across multiple files.<br>
                                      <b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
                                      I think the biggest ‘A-HA’ moment for me was doing the beginning validation at the beginning of processing a new user if the email address already exists.<br>
                                      The second piece was creating the user list and only needing a couple of attributes. I had to pare down the code to make sure it only showed the important stuff that isn’t super sensitive!<br>
                                      <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
                                      Giving myself time to mull over everything definitely helped with getting more done, although it is still sort of incomplete, I can proudly say I did it all by myself and learned it.<br>
                                      <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
                                      Introspectively, I like that I’m making this final push to learn everything and really flesh out this AS program. This class is very challenging and leaving it for the end is no easy feat, however, I really enjoy everything I’m learning.<br>
                                      <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
                                      Still getting more comfortable with everything! And feeling confident that my work is good… and always that piece of time management would be really helpful!<br>

                            <b>What was easy?</b><br>
Following along with the textbook to get through the exercises to get it to work! [As of writing this (8:43 PM on Sunday, May 29), I am one-week late and may not make the deadline :( ].<br>
What was challenging?<br>
I think the challenging part is just how new everything is. Being able to really take the small pieces of just getting information from a database is one thing, but being able to use the information to be able to create sessions for logging in is a whole different story.<br>
<b>Any "A-HA" moments?</b><br>
Going through the examples and trying to work them around the tables/information I already had, I think the ‘A-HA’ was realizing that the information or the way that things were labeled in the table (if they didn’t match the example) means it wouldn’t work in the same way.<br>
I ended up retcifying this by creating a brand new table and changing columns to match conventions.<br>
<b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br>
In undergrad I had one very small PHP class I worked on a project with, with a group, so I’m trying to pull that information from the recesses of my brain.<br>
<b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br>
I think the best thing about my work is that it’s humbling me and teaching me that there is always something to learn and improve on.<br>
And that sometimes… you can’t just cheap your way out of things.<br>
<b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br>
I first need to settle on getting a better webhosting situation for the rest of the semester, and then I’ll figure out the rest.<br>

                            <b>What was easy?</b><br>This is all theorhetical because mine isn't done, but I do like the idea of building out my own social media platform.<br>
                            <b>What was challenging?</b><br>I think the hardest part of the course was the snowballing effect without the proper tools to be able to solve my earlier problems. If I had enough resources and assistance at that point, this probably would've been completed.<br>

                            <b>Anything that is coming together from other courses or experiences?</b><br> Regardless of how this assignment didn't shape up, I learned a lot in the course!<br>
                            <b>What did you like best about your work?</b><br> In partcular, bringing in all my experience from the other classes in the program, I think the biggest thing is that there isn't just one way to design a website. There are so many tools to use depending on what you want.<br>
                            <b>What do you think you can improve upon?</b><br> Practicing this more! I may be finishing my time with the class and the program but this is just the tip of the ice berg for PHP!<br>
